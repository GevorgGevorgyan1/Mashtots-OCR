#**📌 Mashtots OCR - Armenian Handwritten Text Recognition**

This project is an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model designed to recognize Armenian handwritten text using the Mashtots Dataset. It leverages deep learning techniques with TensorFlow/Keras to train a model capable of accurately interpreting Armenian scripts. The project was developed and trained on Google Colab.
